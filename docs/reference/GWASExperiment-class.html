    directly inherits all the properties from the 
    SummarizedExperiment class and extends it with
    respect to holding GWAS data in terms of accomodating not only 
    genotypic and phenotypic data but also association scores and
    SNP effects from Genome-Wide Association tests. In addition,
    as PRISMA's main purpose is the construction and evaluation
    of Polygenic Risk Scores, it offers facilities to store the
    results of respective analyses.    
Specifically, the assays of a GWASExperiment hold a matrix
    object (SnpMatrix or bigSNP) where rows represent SNPs or
    other variants and columns represent samples. The values of
    the assays represent genotypes and they are accessed and
    manipulated through the respective functions of the packages
    snpStats and bigSNP. Apart from the assays,
    the rowData of the GWASExperiment hold information
    about the markers and the colData hold information
    about the samples. Such information are typically derived
    from the initial input data used to construct the 
    GWASExperiment. The easiest way to construct it is from a
    set of PLINK files in BED, BIM and FAM formats. Direct
    construction is also possible, as long as the provided
    information about markers and samples is complete, for
    example, markers should be accompanied at least by
    chromosome and position data as well as major/minor 
    allele information.    
Apart from the basic GWASExperiment data which make direct
    use of the SummarizedExperiment slots, the
    class offers slots to store associated phenotypic and
    anthropometric data for each sample which are used for
    GWA tests, and slots to store the results of these tests
    in terms of p-values and reggression coefficients (effects).
    For the SNPs that may then become part of a PRS, the
    GWASExperiment also offers a slot for storing the weights
    of the PRS SNPs. Furthermore, GWASExperiment takes
    advantage of the metadata slot of the
    SummarizedExperiment to store additional
    information on GWAS and subsequent PRS extraction through
    the GWA summary statistics, such as Principal Component
    Analysis results used as covariates to capture and
    account for potential underlying population stratification,
    reference genome information, track of the filters applied
    to the genotypes and samples and other information. 
    Finally, it offers the ability to avoid genotypic and
    phenotypic data duplication when conducting multiple GWA
    tests by allowing the association and storage of many test
    results (e.g. with different covariates) within the same
    object."><title>GWASExperiment objects — GWASExperiment-class • prisma</title><script src="../deps/jquery-3.6.0/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"><link href="../deps/bootstrap-5.1.0/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"><script src="../deps/bootstrap-5.1.0/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script><!-- Font Awesome icons --><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.12.1/css/all.min.css" integrity="sha256-mmgLkCYLUQbXn0B1SRqzHar6dCnv9oZFPEC1g1cwlkk=" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.12.1/css/v4-shims.min.css" integrity="sha256-wZjR52fzng1pJHwx4aV2AO3yyTOXrcDW7jBpJtTwVxw=" crossorigin="anonymous"><!-- bootstrap-toc --><script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/afeld/bootstrap-toc/v1.0.1/dist/bootstrap-toc.min.js"></script><!-- headroom.js --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/headroom/0.11.0/headroom.min.js" integrity="sha256-AsUX4SJE1+yuDu5+mAVzJbuYNPHj/WroHuZ8Ir/CkE0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/headroom/0.11.0/jQuery.headroom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZX/yNShbjqsohH1k95liqY9Gd8uOiE1S4vZc+9KQ1K4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- clipboard.js --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/clipboard.js/2.0.6/clipboard.min.js" integrity="sha256-inc5kl9MA1hkeYUt+EC3BhlIgyp/2jDIyBLS6k3UxPI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- search --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fuse.js/6.4.6/fuse.js" integrity="sha512-zv6Ywkjyktsohkbp9bb45V6tEMoWhzFzXis+LrMehmJZZSys19Yxf1dopHx7WzIKxr5tK2dVcYmaCk2uqdjF4A==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/autocomplete.js/0.38.0/autocomplete.jquery.min.js" integrity="sha512-GU9ayf+66Xx2TmpxqJpliWbT5PiGYxpaG8rfnBEk1LL8l1KGkRShhngwdXK1UgqhAzWpZHSiYPc09/NwDQIGyg==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mark.js/8.11.1/mark.min.js" integrity="sha512-5CYOlHXGh6QpOFA/TeTylKLWfB3ftPsde7AnmhuitiTX4K5SqCLBeKro6sPS8ilsz1Q4NRx3v8Ko2IBiszzdww==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- pkgdown --><script src="../pkgdown.js"></script><meta property="og:title" content="GWASExperiment objects — GWASExperiment-class"><meta property="og:description" content="The GWASExperiment class is a matrix-like container which

    <p>The GWASExperiment class is a straighforward expansion of the
    <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/SummarizedExperiment/man/RangedSummarizedExperiment-class.html" class="external-link">SummarizedExperiment</a></code> class which is meant for 
    numeric and other data types derived typically from a sequencing 
    experiment but is suitable to host genotypic data as the main 
    features of the latter are Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms 
    (SNPs) which share a lot of common information with sequencing
    experiments such as genomic coordinates and certain types of
    abundance. The structure is rectangular like a <code>matrix</code>, 
    but with additional annotations on the rows and columns, and 
    with the possibility to manage several assays simultaneously 
    so long as they be of the same dimensions. More generic
    information can be found on the manual pages of the
    <a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/SummarizedExperiment/man/RangedSummarizedExperiment-class.html" class="external-link">SummarizedExperiment</a> class. The following focus on the
    expansions introduced in the GWASExperiment class.</p>
<p>The rows of a GWASExperiment object represent SNPs/markers of
    interest. Information about these markers is stored in a
    DataFrame or <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/data.frame.html" class="external-link">data.frame</a> object, accessible 
    using the function <code>gfeatures</code> (or the native 
    <code>rowData</code> as <code>gfeatures</code> is an alias to it). The 
    object must have as many rows as there are rows in the 
    GWASExperiment object, with each row of the object providing 
    information on the SNP in the corresponding row of the 
    GWASExperiment object. Columns of the object represent 
    different attributes of the features of interest. Specifically, 
    for the GWASExperiment case, it must have at least genomic
    coordinates, that is chromosome and position, a unique id (it
    can be a dbSNP id) and the two alleles comprising the genotype.
    A typical case is when the GWASExperiment is created from PLINK
    files with the backend provided by <code>snpStats</code> package
    and the columns of the object are <code>chromosome</code>,
    <code>snp.name</code>, <code>cM</code>, <code>position</code>, <code>allele.1</code>
    and <code>allele.2</code>. These are also the preferred column names
    of the object. It must also have assigned rownames, preferrably
    the same as the <code>snp.names</code> column.</p>
<p>Each column of a GWASExperiment object represents a sample
    (e.g. a person contributing to a GWAS project). Information 
    about the samples are stored in a DataFrame or ,
    <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/data.frame.html" class="external-link">data.frame</a> object, accessible using the function 
    <code>gsamples</code> (or the native <code>colData</code> as 
    <code>gsamples</code> is an alias to it). The object must have as 
    many rows as there are columns in the GWASExperiment object, 
    with each row of the object providing information on the sample
    in the corresponding column of the GWASExperiment object.
    Columns of the object represent different sample attributes, 
    e.g., pedigree, sex etc. Column names typically provide a short 
    identifier unique to each sample. A typical case is when the 
    GWASExperiment is created from PLINK files with the backend 
    provided by <code>snpStats</code> package and the columns of the
    object are <code>pedigree</code>, <code>member</code>, <code>father</code>,
    <code>mother</code>, <code>sex</code> and <code>affected</code>. These are also 
    the preferred column names of the object. It must also have 
    assigned rownames, preferrably the same as the <code>member</code> 
    column.</p>
<p>A GWASExperiment object, as a SummarizedExperiment, can also 
    contain information about the overall experiment, for instance 
    the lab in which it was conducted, the publications with which 
    it is associated, etc. This information is stored as a 
    <code>list</code> object, accessible using the <code>metadata</code> 
    function. The form of the data associated with the experiment
    is left to the discretion of the user. However, the 
    <code>metadata</code> of a GWASExperiment object must have at least
    three elements. These are:</p>    
<p></p><ul><li><p><code>genome</code>: the reference genome used in the
        genotyping technology (usually <code>hg38</code> or <code>hg19</code>).
        It can be accessed and set using the <code>genome</code> function.</p></li>
<li><p><code>filters</code>: the set of filters applied to the
        GWASExperiment to filter out noisy genotyping data (if any)
        and a summary of their results in a <code>data.frame</code>. A
        placeholder is automatically added on construction. It can
        be accessed and set with the <code>filterRecord</code> fuction.</p></li>
<li><p><code>backend</code>: the backend package used to read and
        store the genotype data (one of <code>snpStats</code> or
        <code>bigsnpr</code>). This is crucial for downstream functions
        and manipulation and must not be changed.</p></li>
</ul><p>The GWASExperiment container is appropriate for matrix-like
    genotypic data, such as those derived from gentype microarray
    technologies. Apart from the related SummarizedExperiment data
    accessor functions, the data are accessed using the 
    <code>genotypes</code> function, described below. This returns a
    <a href="SnpMatrix.html">SnpMatrix</a> or bigSNP object. A SimpleList 
    object with genotypic data from potentially different 
    experiment can be accessed with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/SummarizedExperiment/man/SummarizedExperiment-class.html" class="external-link">assays</a></code>. 
    <code>genotypes</code> returns the first one, but typically, this is 
    what is being used. Each element of the list must itself either 
    a <code><a href="SnpMatrix.html">SnpMatrix</a></code> or a codebigSNP object and must have 
    dimensions that are the same as the dimensions of the
    GWASExperiment in which they are stored. Row and column
    names of each object must either be <code>NULL</code> or match those 
    of the GWASExperiment during construction.</p>    
<p>Furthermore, the GWASExperiment offers facilities for storing
    other data typical for subsequent GWAS analyses and PRS
    constructions, such as storing phenotypic and anthropometric
    data used for association analysis, the results of GWA tests
    and the results of PRS analysis. Instead of storing these
    data to the metadata slot of a SummarizedExperiment, they
    are bound to slots following the dimensions and subsetting
    of the main genotypic matrix object. Therefore, phenotypic
    data are accessed through the <code>phenotypes</code> function,
    the results of GWA tests (p-values, regression coefficients)
    are accessed through the <code>pvalues</code> and <code>effects</code>
    functions respectively, and associated PRS weights are
    accessed throught the function <code>prsbetas</code>. All these
    functions are described below and all return 
    <code>SimpleList</code> objects, as a GWASExperiment object may
    have multiple GWA and PRS results attached to it to avoid
    genotype repetition. A listing of associated analyses
    with a GWASExperiment object may be retrieved with the
    <code>listGwa</code> and <code>listPrs</code> functions and the 
    functions <code>allPvalues</code>, <code>allEffects</code> and
    <code>allPrsbetas</code> can be used to retrieve a list of
    all the analyses results.</p>

    accessors such as <code>rowData</code>, <code>colData</code>, <code>dim</code>
    etc. Details can be found in the respective man pages. General
    patterns such as that row data must have <code>NULL</code> or identical
    row names as with the main matrix object (here, the genotypes)
    are assumed.</p>

<dd><p>Get or set the p-values after the application of one or more
    genotype-phenotype association tests. <code>response</code> is the
    phenotype for which the association test is performed. It can be
    a numeric or integer value denoting the column number in the 
    phenotypes data frame which is associated with x <code>value</code>,
    or a character in which case it's the name of the phenotype and
    corresponds to a column name of the aforementioned data frame. 
    It defaults to the first available phenotype. <code>covariates</code>
    are the phenotypic covariates to be included in an association 
    model and must be available in the phenotypes data frame. It can
    be either a numeric/integer vector denoting column numbers or
    a character vector denoting column names of the phenotypes data
    frame. It defaults to <code>NULL</code> for no addition of covariates,
    other than the main phenotype (<code>response</code>). <code>npcs</code>
    denotes the number of PCs to include in the model as additional
    covariates to capture potential population substructures. It
    defaults to <code>0</code> for no PCs as additional covariates. For
    <code>withDimnames</code>, see above e.g. <code>gfeatures</code>. The
    reason for this accessor to have additional arguments
    (<code>response</code>, <code>covariates</code>, <code>npcs</code>) is that
    <code>x</code> may have multiple association test results attached
    to it, and these variable offer a way of unique access to
    them. Finally, <code>value</code> is a numeric matrix with p-values
    for each SNP. This matrix has as many columns as the different

    accessor. <code>value</code> is a numeric matrix with effects for

    section of the <a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/SummarizedExperiment/man/RangedSummarizedExperiment-class.html" class="external-link">SummarizedExperiment</a> help page. There 
    are restrictions in the case of a GWASExperiment as in the

    <h2 id="combining">Combining<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#combining"></a></h2>
    <p>The combining functions of GWASExperiment objects follow the
    same principles as those of SummarizedExperiment objects.
    Special attention is given regarding the integrity of the main
    SummarizedExperiment class extensions. These are briefly the 
    phenotypes which follow the samples (columns/colData) of
    the GWASExperiment object and statistical scores parallel to
    the features (rowData) of the object (pvalues, effects etc.).</p>    
<p>When combining objects, the following attributes and values are
    not preserved, as they become meaningless with the combination
    of samples and/or SNPs:</p>    
<p></p><ul><li><p><code>pvalues, effects, prsbetas</code>: these scores are
        dropped as the initial population in potentially both 
        samples and SNPs from which they were derived is changed.</p></li>
<li><p><code>filters</code>: any filtered SNPs/samples statistics
        are re-initialized as the population of SNPs/samples is
        changed.</p></li>
<li><p>any values related to PCA, as again, these statistics
        depend on the population which changes with object 
        combination.</p></li>

    <p>The splitting operations differ from the classic

    object may curry multiple associated GWA and PRS analyses
    using different sets of covariates. These can be preserved
    by using the <code>gsplit</code> function which operates across
