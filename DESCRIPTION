Description: prisma is an R package for the semi-automated construction and
evaluation of Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) with data from multiple summary 
statistics and PRS extraction algorithms. prisma supports several Genome Wide
Association (GWA) tests for the calculation of summary statistics and integrates 
the results of multiple PRS algorithms. In addition, it offers multiple PRS 
evaluation criteria and a semi-automated optimal PRS selection process through
the local maximization of evaluation criteria. Finally, it integrates GWA 
effects with linear programming and helps the user select the best PRS through
a rich report of the results and online search in the GWAS Catalog.
