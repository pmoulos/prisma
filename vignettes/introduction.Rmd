# Introduction

The rise of modern genotyping technologies such as Next Generation Sequencing
(Whhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing) as well as the continuous thriving of
older genotyping technologies such as genotyping DNA microarrays have allowed an
unprecedented collection of massive, large-cohort and population-level genetic
data spanning a variety of application, from medical research to consumer
genomics. At the same time, several perspective and sometimes country-level
studies are reaching maturity levels regarding the amount and quality of 
data collected at various levels such as anthropometric, phenotypic, biomarker
and genetic levels, and some times other molecular -omics layers such as gene 
expression. The aforementioned facts have allowed not only for more accurate
and versatile Genome-Wide Association Studies to identify the potential genetic
cause for many simple or more complex genetic traits but also combine phenotypic
and genotypic data in unique ways to derive multi-way genetic signatures that
characterize individuals with respect to several anthropometric features as well
as these traits and biomarker levels. These genetic signatures have a seamingly
endless portfolio of applications, spanning the characterization of the 
predisposition of an individual to general healthstyle issues such as obesity
and up to estimating the risk to several diseases like cancer and other 
potential life-threatening conditions including cardiovascular disease and
kidney malfunction. They are also used to characterize less life-threatening
conditions but which deteriorate the general well-being such as psychological
disease and anomalies of the central nervous system.
